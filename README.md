## 📍 About Me

I'm a systems-minded builder focused on **digital autonomy**, **agent architecture**, and **composable toolchains**.  
My current work explores how systems can enhance workflows, memory, and quality of work-life.

I specialize in:
- Declarative platform development (Salesforce)
- Local/private infrastructure (Obsidian, Python, containerization)
- Autonomous system scaffolding (LLM agents, behavioral orchestration, memory stacks)

> I believe in building systems that think with you—not just for you.
